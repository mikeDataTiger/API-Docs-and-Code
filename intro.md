# Introduction 
Welcome to the DataTiger APIs! 

Our APIs are split into two main APIs:

1. **Events API:** everything you need to get your data into DataTiger
2. **Management API:** the setup of all components, i.e. user journeys and segments, are handled by this API
    
Our APIs are organized around REST. All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON. We also have some specific language bindings to make integration easier. You can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right of the API docs.

Currently we support the following official client bindings:
* Ruby
* Node
* Python
* Java

To play around with a few examples, we recommend a REST client called Postman. Simply tap the button below to import our API spec.
